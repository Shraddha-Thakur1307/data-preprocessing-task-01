Customer Personality Analysis: Data Preprocessing
  This repository documents the data cleaning and preprocessing phase for the Customer Personality Analysis dataset. 
  The primary goal of this phase is to transform the raw data into a clean, consistent, and analysis-ready format suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The following steps were performed to prepare the dataset.

Data Preprocessing Pipeline
The entire data cleaning process was executed in a sequential manner to handle a variety of data quality issues.

1. Initial Data Structuring
The raw dataset, originally in a text-based format, was loaded and parsed into a structured DataFrame. This initial step involved correctly splitting the data into its respective columns, which laid the groundwork for all subsequent cleaning and analysis tasks.

2. Handling Missing Values
Upon inspection, the Income column was found to contain several missing entries.

Action Taken: All blank or null entries in the Income column were imputed with the value 0.

Rationale: This initial step ensures that the column is numerically complete. While 0 is a placeholder, it prevents errors in subsequent numerical computations. Further analysis could explore more sophisticated imputation methods like using the mean or median if required.

3. Removal of Unnecessary Columns
The dataset contained columns that provided no analytical value.

Columns Identified: Z_CostContact and Z_Revenue.

Action Taken: These columns were dropped from the dataset.

Rationale: Both columns contained a single, constant value for all customers. Such features have zero variance and add no discriminatory information for any analytical or modeling task.

4. Harmonization of Categorical Data
Several categorical columns had inconsistent or nonsensical values that required standardization.

Education:

Issue: The column contained ambiguous categories like "2n Cycle".

Action Taken: These categories were mapped to a standardized and more understandable format (e.g., "Master's" or "Postgraduate"). This ensures that educational achievements are grouped accurately.

Marital_Status:

Issue: The column had overlapping categories ("Married", "Together") and illogical entries ("YOLO", "Absurd", "Alone").

Action Taken:

Overlapping categories like "Married" and "Together" were consolidated into a single category (e.g., "In Relationship").

Nonsensical entries were investigated and mapped to more logical categories (e.g., "Alone" was mapped to "Single") or treated as null values.

5. Correction of Data Types
To perform correct calculations and analysis, several columns needed their data types to be converted.

Dt_Customer:

Issue: This column, representing the customer's enrollment date, was stored as a text (object) type.

Action Taken: The column was converted to a proper datetime format. This is crucial for any time-series analysis, such as calculating customer tenure.

Income:

Issue: After handling missing values, the column could still be treated as a text/object type if it contained currency symbols or commas.

Action Taken: The Income column was explicitly converted to a numerical (float or int) data type to enable mathematical operations.

6. Duplicate Record Removal
Ensuring data integrity requires that each record uniquely represents a single entity.

Issue: The dataset was suspected to have duplicate entries for the same customer.

Action Taken: The dataset was checked for duplicate rows based on the customer ID column. All identified duplicates were removed.

Rationale: This step ensures that each customer is represented only once, preventing any skew in the analysis and bias in model training.

Conclusion
After executing these six steps, the dataset is now considered clean, consistent, and properly formatted. It is now ready for the next stages of the project.
